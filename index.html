    <h4><b>Best Osaka Restaurants</b></h4> 
    <p> Here, I’ve chosen the best approachable restaurants in Osaka. They’re all located in areas you’re likely to visit (ie, the main urban hubs). Yes, in some cases there are better restaurants in Osaka, but they’re not good for casual visitors to the city (ie, they’re inconveniently located, they’re too expensive or they’re difficult for foreigners to reserve or to enter). The restaurants listed here are places you can actually go to and enjoy, most without any reservations.</p>

    <h4><b>Osaka Districts</b></h4> 
    <p> Osaka is a bipolar city – it’s divided into two major urban hubs: Kita and Minami (which mean North and South in Japanese). There are three other major hubs around these, as well as Shin-Osaka (the city’s bullet train station). And don’t forget that Osaka is a prefecture and not just a city and there are some great sights outside of the city proper. </p>
